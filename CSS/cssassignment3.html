    <h1 class="heading">Typography</h1>
    <p class="para">Typography is all around us, shaping how we experience written words. Take a look at a magazine cover. The bold headline in a modern sans-serif font like Helvetica might grab your attention, while the smaller serif font in the subtitle offers a more classic feel. This is the essence of typography - using different fonts, sizes, and arrangements to create visual impact and communicate a message. From the elegance of serif fonts in a book to the playful display fonts on a birthday card, typography plays a vital role in conveying information and setting the tone.</p>
