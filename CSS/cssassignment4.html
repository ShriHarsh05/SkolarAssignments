    <h1>CSS Box Model</h1>
    <div class="content-box"><h1>Content-box model</h1><p>Lorem Ipsum is a placeholder text commonly used in publishing and graphic design to demonstrate the visual form of a document or typeface without relying on meaningful content. The text is typically a corrupted version of De finibus bonorum et malorum, a 1st-century BC text by the Roman statesman and philosopher Cicero.<br>History of Lorem Ipsum<br>
        The origins of Lorem Ipsum date back to the 15th century, when an unknown typesetter is thought to have scrambled parts of Cicero’s De Finibus in order to provide placeholder text to mockup various fonts for a type specimen book. The text was popularized in the 1960s with Letraset’s dry-transfer sheets, and later entered the digital world via Aldus PageMaker.
